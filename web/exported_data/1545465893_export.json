            "Issue Date: June 13, 2004\n\nCatherine Zeta Jones\nhas arrived, but don't make a big deal about it\n\nBy Dana Kennedy\n\nAfter Catherine Zeta-Jones started dating Michael\nDouglas in 1998, her future husband warned her about the\n\nmedia frenzy that would follow. Zeta-Jones, then 29 and\n\n{fresh off her first Hollywood hit, \"The Mask of Zorro,\" didn't\n\nbat an eye. Although virtually unknown in America until\n\nthen, Zeta-Jones had been a huge star in England because petet erent\nof her role as a voluptuous country girl in a TV series, \"The\n\nDarling Buds of May.\" The show was a phenomenon in the\n\nearly \u201890s, and Zeta-Jones became a staple of the British\n\ntabloids. \"Literally, with one hour of television my life\n\ncompletely changed,\" she says. \"I couldn't go anywhere.\"\n\n  \n   \n\n \n\nSo she began to \u201cbuild\na barrier\" around\nherself, which, no\ndoubt, came in handy\nafter she met Douglas.\n\"When Michael told me\nwhat was going to\nhappen, I said, \u2018It's\nfine,\u2019 \" she recalls. \"I\ntold him, \u2018You should\ngo in the archives and\nsee what was written\nabout me.' And when\neverything erupted, it\nwas water off a duck's\n\nback.\" 7\nec! \"The biggest misconception of\n\nme is that I'm some die-hard,\nambitious, do-anything-to-\nget-anything kind of person.\u201d\n\n \n\nThat Zeta-Jones, now\n34, can handle\nanything life hands her\nseems an integral part\nof her personality. Whatever her deepest emotions, she\nkeeps them in check. She became a star after a string of\ndragon-lady roles in \"Entrapment,\" \"Traffic\" and \u201cAmerica's\nSweethearts\" before she was handed the 2002 best\nsupporting actress Oscar for Chicago.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nIf her public image has been tainted by a whiff of\noverweening ambition, she can thank her slightly gauche\n2000 wedding at the Plaza Hotel; pocketing a reported\n$800,000 from Britain's OK! magazine for pictures of her\nand Douglas\u2019 newborn son; and her puzzling decision to act\nas a T-Mobile spokeswoman at the peak of her career. The\nHollywood A-list considers doing commercials tacky and\ncrass. If stars make them at all, it's overseas, where the\nAmerican public can't see them.\n\n\u2018Yet once you meet Zeta-Jones, the \"get more\" image you\nmay have of her disappears. The first clue that she may not\nbe an opportunistic trophy wife comes at the start of our\ninterview, which takes place at a Manhattan restaurant on\nthe Hudson River. Someone's late, and there's a delay. But\nithe tardy diva in this case is not the star; it's the writer.\nDoes she mind being kept waiting? Not at all, it turns out.\nShe settles down in a booth as if she has all the time in the\nworld.\n\nIt turns out Zeta-Jones, while confident, is not as steely as\nshe might seem. She had a bad case of butterflies, for\nexample, when she arrived for her first day of filming on\n\"The Terminal,\" the Steven Spielberg movie opening next\nweekend. In a departure from her strong-woman parts,\nZeta-Jones plays a flighty flight attendant named Amelia."

            "clence\n\n& print Email to a friend\n\nMysterious meteorite dust mismatch solved\nThursday, 1 May 2003\n\nJapanese scientists think they might have worked\nout the reason for a curious mismatch in\ncomposition between the dust that falls to Earth\nfrom colliding asteroids, and the asteroids that are\nactually out there.\n\nA team of researchers led by Professor Kazushige\nTomeoka from Kobe University in Japan report on\ntheir experiments with meteorites in today's issue of\nthe journal Nature.\n\nMost asteroids orbit between Mars and Jupiter, but\ncollisions between them can knock the asteroids off\n\ncourse and put them out of orbit, sometimes\n\ncausing them to crash to the Earth as meteors and meteorites.\n\nEach year tens of thousands of tonnes of meteorite dust from colliding asteroids\nrains down on the Earth. The researchers set out to explain the reason why,\nalthough the vast majority of asteroids are hydrous (containing water), nearly 98%\nof the dust that falls to Earth is anhydrous (water-free) - albeit with a similar\nchemistry and minerology to the watery dust.\n\nIna series of laboratory experiments Tomeoka and team shot at hydrous and\nanhydrous samples of meteorites to simulate the \u2018shock pressure\u2019 that occurs when\nasteroids collide in space. They subjected the meteorites to different levels of\npressure, from 4 to 49 Giga-Pascals (GPa). To give an indication of the level of\npressure involved, 26Gpa is the pressure 660km inside the Earth at which the crust\nbegins to turn into molten lava.\n\nThe researchers found that hydrated\nmeteorites broke up more easily under the\npressure of impact and when they did their\nwater content vapourised. This means that\nwhat might end up as water-free dust on\nEarth may have started off being part of a\nhydrated asteroid, the researchers argue.\n\n\u201cTt has been speculated that what hits the\nEarth is not representative of what is out\nthere,\" commented Dr Hugh O'Neill from the\nSchool of Earth Sciences at the Australian\nNational University, who does research into\n\nThe anhyd\n\nafter the same impact s\n\nthe chemistry of meteorites\n\n\"What they have shown, and its neat stuff, but not all that surprising, is the kind of\nshocks that occur when two asteroids collide causes complete disintegration of the\nhydrated ones,\" he told ABC Science Online.\n\nAstronomers know that asteroids have been exposed to shock pressure because\nsome asteroids contain the same sort of high pressure minerals found deep inside\nthe Earth. Asteroids are much smaller than the Earth, which means that impacts\nwith other asteroids are the only explanation for these minerals.\n\nOur knowledge of the composition of asteroids comes from spectral imaging which\nanalyses the surface of asteroids in space. This form of imaging has limitations in\nthat it can only observe what is on the surface of the asteroid and this may be\ncontaminated by dust resulting from weathering in space.\n\nDanny Kingsley - ABC Science Online\n\nDC ey\n\n, Science Home>> News in Science = Features = Explore = TV & Radio = Dr Karl = Play = Podcasts\n\nera Cy\nPc ae)\neras ot\noe wey\nCrees at\n\neR Cue mush\n\nney\n\nEars pee\n\nCO en Cac Rag\n\nRDU a Cae ee Ru Red\n\nTray\nReena\n\nas\nLE Ngo id\n\nuae gy\n\nbbe bbe\nSea SoA!\n\nee ala\n\nSea Ce\n\nDNA & Genetics\n\neee ae cuca\nPio\n\neae\n\nSRC\noy\nSeries eel"
