### Compiling Python
To compile Python on CHTC, run `condor_submit -i compile.sub`. After the
interactive session has started, run `chmod +x compile.sh` and then
`./compile.sh`. Once the script has finished running, enter `exit` to exit the
interactive session. You should see a zipped file named `python.tar.gz` in
your home directory after following these instructions.
