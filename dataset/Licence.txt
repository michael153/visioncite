Scanned pages (all images) are available in the dataset exclusively for 
personal research and, in general, must not be reproduced in any form 
(even in scientific publications) without the permission of the 
copyright holder(s). Information on the copyright holder(s) is displayed 
for every page image in the dataset in order to make it possible to identify 
who to seek permission from.
We are working towards securing permission from publishers so that researchers 
can freely use images and reproduce them in scientific publications. 
Wherever such permission is available, it is indicated in the metadata and 
displayed for each page image.
